# Third Homework

The homeworks in this repository cover a variety of deep learning models and techniques, including:

### **Homework 1: Semantic Segmentation and Model Fine-tuning**
This homework focuses on the task of semantic segmentation using models like SAM (Segment Anything Model). The tasks include:

- **Data Preparation:** Preparing satellite images and corresponding masks for training and evaluation.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained model for segmentation tasks.
- **Data Augmentation:** Implementing various augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient.
- **Fine-Tuning for Mask Detection:** Fine-tuning a segmentation model to enhance its accuracy on specific objects in satellite images.

### **Homework 2: Faster RCNN for Object Detection**
This homework covers object detection with the Faster RCNN model. The tasks include:

- **Faster RCNN Overview:** Learning and implementing Faster RCNN for detecting objects in images.
- **Preprocessing:** Resizing and preparing the image dataset, and aligning annotations.
- **Training the Model:** Training Faster RCNN on a custom dataset and analyzing the training process.
- **Bounding Box Prediction:** Analyzing and evaluating the performance of the bounding box predictions on test data.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning the Faster RCNN model to improve performance on the selected dataset.
