# Second Homework

The homeworks in this repository cover a variety of deep learning models and techniques, including:

- **Homework 1: CNN-based Emotion Recognition**  
  The first homework focuses on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify facial emotions. We explore different architectures like AlexNet, VGGNet, and MobileNet, evaluating their performance on image datasets. Techniques like data augmentation are employed to enhance the model's generalization ability.

- **Homework 2: COVID-19 Diagnosis using Chest X-rays**  
  The second homework addresses the classification of COVID-19 patients based on chest X-ray images using CNN models. This task involves data preprocessing, augmentation, model fine-tuning, and evaluating the trained network on test data, measuring performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
