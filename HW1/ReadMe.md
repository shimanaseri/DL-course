# First Homework

The homeworks in this repository cover a variety of deep learning models and techniques, including:

### **Homework 1: Neural Networks and Perceptrons**
This assignment introduces several foundational neural network models, including:

- **Mcculloch-Pitts Neuron**  
  You will design a binary multiplier using the Mcculloch-Pitts neuron, focusing on building a neural network that takes two 2-bit inputs and produces a binary result.

- **AdaLine and MadaLine**  
  This part involves training a neural network using the AdaLine and MadaLine algorithms for binary classification problems with two-dimensional data. You'll explore error graphs and experiment with varying data distributions.

- **Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)**  
  A collaborative filtering problem is tackled here, where you will use an RBM to build a recommendation system based on movie ratings, following steps like data merging, normalization, and training a model to make predictions.

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**  
  The final task focuses on building a Multi-Layer Perceptron to predict house prices using a given dataset. You'll use techniques such as feature engineering, scaling, and training a deep neural network with different optimizers and loss functions.

### **Homework 2: AdaLine and MadaLine**
This homework dives into linear classifiers, AdaLine, and MadaLine, focusing on training and testing on datasets with varying distributions of features. Key tasks include:

- Training AdaLine to classify data points and plotting error curves.
- Comparing results based on different feature distributions.
- Implementing MadaLine and testing its performance with various configurations.

### **Homework 3: Autoencoders and K-Means**
This homework explores clustering and dimensionality reduction, specifically:

- **Autoencoders (AE)**  
  Training and evaluating an autoencoder model for dimensionality reduction and learning representations of input data.

- **K-Means Clustering**  
  Applying K-means clustering on data and comparing it with the results from the autoencoder to understand the model's clustering ability.

### **Homework 4: Recommendation Systems and MLP**
This assignment further explores the concept of recommendation systems using deep learning models. You will be:

- Using a collaborative filtering approach with the RBM to recommend items based on user ratings.
- Building a Multi-Layer Perceptron to predict house prices and learning how various optimizers and loss functions impact model performance.
