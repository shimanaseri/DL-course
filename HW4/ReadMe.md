# Forth Homework

The homeworks in this repository cover a variety of deep learning models and techniques, including:

### **Homework 1: Time Series Forecasting**
This homework focuses on forecasting stock prices using time series data. The tasks include:

- **Data Download and Preparation:** Downloading financial data from Yahoo Finance for selected stocks, preparing it for modeling.
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Analyzing and handling missing values, and exploring the stock price returns using visualization techniques.
- **Time Series Split:** Applying TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation to assess model performance over time.
- **Model Development:** Developing and training models for predicting future stock prices, using neural networks and other forecasting models.

### **Homework 2: Social Media Suicide Ideation Detection**
This homework focuses on detecting suicidal ideation from social media posts using natural language processing techniques. The tasks include:

- **Preprocessing the Text Data:** Cleaning and processing the text data, including removing stop words, lemmatization, and vectorizing text using Word2Vec.
- **Model Development:** Training deep learning models such as CNN + 2-layer LSTM and standalone LSTM to classify suicide-related ideations in social media posts.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing the results from different models and analyzing their performance based on accuracy and other metrics.
